## RGF (Regularized Greedy Forest)
<br>


The **RGF** package is a wrapper of the [Regularized Greedy Forest (RGF)](https://github.com/fukatani/rgf_python) *python* package, which also includes a [Multi-core implementation (FastRGF)](https://github.com/baidu/fast_rgf). More details on the functionality of the RGF package can be found in the package Documentation and Vignette.

<br>

### **System Requirements**

<br>

* Python (>= 2.7)


<br>

All modules should be installed in the default python configuration (the configuration that the R-session displays as default), otherwise errors will occur during the *RGF* package installation (**reticulate::py_discover_config()** might be useful here). 

<br>

The installation notes for *Linux, Macintosh, Windows* are based on *Python 2.7*.

<br>

#### **Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora** 

<br>

First install / upgrade the dependencies,

<br>

```R
sudo pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

sudo pip install -U numpy

sudo pip install --upgrade scipy

sudo pip install -U scikit-learn
```

<br>

Then, download both *rgf* and *fast_rgf* by opening a console and giving,

<br>


```R

git clone --recursive https://github.com/fukatani/rgf_python.git


```

<br>

By using the *recursive* parameter the *fast_rgf* folder will be included in the downoladed data. Then install both *rgf* and *fast_rgf* using the following command:

<br>

```R
cd rgf_python

sudo python setup.py install 
```
<br>

*FastRGF* will be installed successfully only if gcc >= 5.0.

<br><br>



#### **Macintosh OSX** 
<br>


First do a fresh install of python using brew  [ normally the brew-python will appear as python2, because python comes by default in Macintosh OS ]

<br>

```R
brew install python

brew link --overwrite python
```
<br>

Then update the *.bash_profile* file in home directory with the following paths

<br>

```R
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH

export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"
```
<br>

Then install the dependencies for *RGF* and *FastRGF*

<br>

```R
sudo pip2 install --upgrade pip setuptools

sudo pip2 install -U numpy

sudo pip2 install --upgrade scipy

sudo pip2 install -U scikit-learn
```
<br>


In case that an error appears for any of the previous installation commands, run one (or all) of the following (depending on which module wasn't correctly installed),

<br>

```R
sudo pip2 install --upgrade --ignore-installed --install-option '--install-data=/usr/local' numpy

sudo pip2 install --upgrade --ignore-installed --install-option '--install-data=/usr/local' scipy

sudo pip2 install --upgrade --ignore-installed --install-option '--install-data=/usr/local' scikit-learn
```

<br>

The *FastRGF* module requires a gcc >= 5.0. To install *gcc-7* with brew do,

<br>

```R
brew install gcc

brew link --overwrite gcc

export CXX=g++-7 && export CC=gcc-7
```

<br>

then create a symbolic link

<br>

```R
cd /usr/local/bin

ln -s gcc-7 gcc
```

<br>

Then continue with the installation of *fast_rgf* and *rgf* python,

<br>

```R

git clone --recursive https://github.com/fukatani/rgf_python.git


cd rgf_python/include/fast_rgf/build

export CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++-7 && export CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc-7

cmake rgf_python/include/fast_rgf

make

sudo make install


cd

cd rgf_python/include/rgf/build

export CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++-7 && export CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc-7

cmake rgf_python/include/rgf

make

sudo make install
```

<br>

Then install both *rgf* and *fast-rgf* using the following command,

<br>

```R
cd 

cd rgf_python

sudo python2 setup.py install                 
```

<br>

After a successful rgf-python installation the user should open an R session and give the following *reticulate* command to change to the relevant (brew-python) directory (otherwise the RGF package won't work properly),

<br>

```R

reticulate::use_python('/usr/local/bin/python2')


```

<br>

and then,

<br>


```R

reticulate::py_discover_config()


```

<br>

to validate that a user is in the python version where *RGF* or *FastRGF* are installed. Then,

<br>

```R

install.packages(RGF)


library(RGF)


```

<br>


to load the R package. It is possible that the following warning in the R session appears if *FastRGF* is not installed,

<br>

```R

UserWarning: Cannot find FastRGF executable files. FastRGF estimators will be unavailable for usage.
  warnings.warn("Cannot find FastRGF executable files. FastRGF estimators will be unavailable for usage.")
  
```

<br><br>

#### **Windows OS**

<br>

First download of [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) for windows

<br>

Update the Environment variables ( Control Panel >> System and Security >> System >> Advanced system settings >> Environment variables >> System variables >> Path >> Edit ) by adding ( for instance in case of python 2.7 ),

<br>

```R

C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts


```

<br>

Install the [Visual C++ 2015 Build Tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools)

<br>

Open the Command prompt (console) and install the *rgf_python* dependencies,

<br>

```R

pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

pip install -U numpy

pip install --upgrade scipy

pip install -U scikit-learn


```

<br>

Then download *git* for windows,

<br>

```R

https://git-scm.com/download/win


```
<br>

and run the downloaded  *.exe* file. Then do,

<br>

```R

git clone --recursive https://github.com/fukatani/rgf_python.git


```

<br>

*FastRGF* requires a gcc version > 5.0 . To find out the gcc version, open a command prompt (console) and type,

<br>

```R

gcc --version


```

<br>

**Installation / Upgrade of MinGW**

<br>

**Perform the following steps to upgrade the MinGW (so that simple RGF functions work â€“ but not FastRGF)**

<br>

Normally MinGW is installed in the **C:\\** directory. So, first delete the folder **C:\\MinGW** (if it already exists), and then remove the environment variable from (Control Panel >> System and Security >> System >> Advanced system settings >> Environment variables >> System variables >> Path >> Edit) which usually is **C:\\MinGW\\bin**. Then download the most recent version of [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started), and especially the **mingw-get-setup.exe** which is an *automated GUI installer assistant*. After the new version is installed successfully, update the environment variable by adding **C:\\MinGW\\bin** in (Control Panel >> System and Security >> System >> Advanced system settings >> Environment variables >> System variables >> Path >> Edit). Then open a new command prompt (console) and type, 

<br>

```R

gcc --version


```
<br>

to find out if the new version of *MinGW* is installed properly.
 
<br>
 
A word of caution, If *Rtools* is already installed then make sure that it does not point to an older version of gcc. Just observe the *Path* field of the *environment variables* (accessible as explained previously).

<br>


**Perform the following steps only in case that a FastRGF installation is desired and gcc version is < 5.0**

<br>

*FastRGF* works only with [MinGW-w64](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php ) because only this version provides POSIX threads. It can be downloaded from [MingW-W64-builds](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download). After a successful download and installation the user should also update the environment variables field in (Control Panel >> System and Security >> System >> Advanced system settings >> Environment variables >> System variables >> Path >> Edit) by adding the following path (assuming the software is installed in **C:\\Program Files (x86)** folder),

<br>

```R

C:\Program Files (x86)\mingw-w64\i686-7.2.0-posix-dwarf-rt_v5-rev1\mingw32\bin


```

<br>

**Installation of cmake**

<br>

First download cmake for Windows, [win64-x64 Installer](https://cmake.org/download/).
Once the file is downloaded run the **.exe** file and during installation make sure to **add CMake to the system PATH for all users**.

<br>

Before the installation of *rgf* I might have to remove *Rtools* environment variables, such as **C:\\Rtools\\bin** (accessible as explained previously), otherwise errors might occur.

<br>

**installation of rgf**

<br>

Open a console with **administrator privileges** (right click on cmd and *run as administrator*), then do

<br>

```R

cd rgf_python/include/rgf/build

cmake ../ -G "MinGW Makefiles"

mingw32-make

mingw32-make install

cd C:\

```

<br>

**installation of fast_rgf**

<br>

```R

cd rgf_python/include/fast_rgf/build

cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"

mingw32-make

mingw32-make install

cd C:\

```

<br>

Installation (of both) in python

<br>

```R

cd rgf_python

python setup.py install


```

<br>

Then open a command prompt (console) and type,

<br>

```R

python 


```

<br>

to launch *Python* and then type 

<br>

```R

import rgf


```

<br>

to observe if *rgf* is installed properly. Then continue with the installation of the RGF package,

<br>

```R

install.packages(RGF)


```

<br>

On windows the user can take advantage of the RGF package currently **only** from within the command prompt (console). First, find the full path of the installation location of R (possible if someone right-clicks in the R short-cut (probably on Desktop) and navigates to properties >> shortcut >> target). In my OS, for instance, R is located in **C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-3.4.0\\bin\\x64\\R**. Then, by opening a command prompt (console) and giving (for instance in my case),

<br>

```R

cd C:\Program Files\R\R-3.4.0\bin\x64\

R

library(RGF)


```
<br>

one can proceed with the usage of the RGF package.

<br>


### **Installation of the RGF package**

<br>

To install the package from CRAN use, 

<br>

```R

install.packages('RGF')


```
<br>

and to download the latest version from Github use the *install_github* function of the devtools package,
<br><br>

```R

devtools::install_github(repo = 'mlampros/RGF')

```
